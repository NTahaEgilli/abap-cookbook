# 🚀 ABAP Best Practices

A public, community-driven collection of **clean**, **maintainable**, and **modern ABAP** programs.

This repo exists to show *how ABAP can be written well* — not just how to make it work.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Share real-world ABAP examples that follow best practices
- Promote readable, modern, and scalable ABAP code
- Encourage discussion and continuous improvement through contributions

This is opinionated by design — but open to better ideas.

---

## 📦 What you’ll find here

- Reusable ABAP programs and utilities  
- Examples using **modern ABAP syntax (7.40+)**
- Clean OO patterns where they make sense
- Proper error handling and performance-aware code

---

## 🧭 Guiding principles

- Readability over cleverness
- Clean code > quick fixes
- Explicit logic beats magic
- OO where it adds value
- No obsolete statements
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*
